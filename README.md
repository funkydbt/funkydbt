Hello, I'm funkydbt 👋

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm a passionate Data Engineer with a solid background in leveraging tools like Databricks, Data Factory, and Spark to manage, ingest, and transform data from various sources into Azure Blob Storage.

About Me:
- 🛠  Skills: My expertise lies in SQL and PySpark, and I'm currently delving into the world of dbt. I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace new challenges in data engineering.
- 🌱 Learning Goals: I'm on a mission to master dbt, Airflow, and Snowflake. My goal is to reach an expert level in these technologies, enabling me to build more efficient, scalable, and robust data platforms.
- 🤝 Collaboration: I am keen on collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of data engineering, especially those that leverage the power of dbt and related technologies.
- ⚽ Personal Interests: When I'm not crunching data, you can find me enjoying a game of football, spending quality time in fellowship, catching up with friends, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
- 💡 Open to Opportunities: I'm always open to opportunities that allow me to grow and apply my skills in new and challenging environments.

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to have a chat about data, football, or anything in between!
